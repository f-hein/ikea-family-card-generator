# **Ikea Family Card Generator**
## **CODE USAGE IS FOR STRICTLY EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY! I DO NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY MISUSE OF UPLOADED CODE NOR GENERATED CARD LOOKALIKES.**

### What is this thing?
  It's a small side project for generating Ikea Family Membership Card. It allows you to create Ikea Family Membership Card lookalike in just a few seconds.

### What do I need to run this thing?
  You'll need to operate on Python 3.x and have those three libraries downloaded:
  - requests
  - luhn
  - Pillow
  
  After that you just run the .py file and follow the instructions displayed in the terminal. 
  Finished card lookalike will be saved in the directory in which the file was run.
  
**Disclaimer:** _Every file and data such as font name or API endpoint was scraped from Ikea website. 
I'd like to point out that this is widely available data for every person._ I've just spared some of my time digging around ;)
